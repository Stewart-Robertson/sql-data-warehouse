# Creating a SQL Server Data Warehouse

## The Project's Aim   🎯  

To take raw Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) data and make a business-ready relational database that can be used for analysis, reporting, machine learning, etc.

## The Data Warehouse Architecture 🏛️

A SQL Server database will be created and follow a "medallion" architecture, that is:

![data_architecture cropped](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d150cbbd-98c1-4a7f-b636-e41e5898782a)


**The data sources:**:
* **CRM**: A folder containing three csv files containing data on customers, products, and sales, respectively
* **ERP**: A folder containing three css files containing data on customers, products, and customer locations, respectively

The raw data is loaded into the bronze layer with no changes. It is then cleaned, transformed, normalised, and standardised as it is loaded into the silver layer. Finally, the silver layer tables are aggregated and combined with business logic in the gold layer to provide business-ready analytical data.

SQL is used at all stages of the process to load, clean, aggregate, integrate, standardise, and query the data.

## Software/Tech Used

|Tech|Purpose  |
|--|--|
| SQL |Building the database, tables and views, cleaning and validating the data, etc.  |
| SQL Server | Hosting the database |
| Azure Data Studio | Interfacing with and managing the database. I wanted to use SQL Server but I use a Mac and so can't download a Windows-based RDMS e.g. SSMS |
| Docker | Again, as I use a Mac I cannot download SQL Server. Instead, I ran the most recent Ubuntu release of SQL Server in a Docker container |
| Command Line | Configuring Docker container, configuring connection between ADS and Docker, moving files, etc. |
| Drawio | Building diagrams e.g. Data Architecture, Data Flow, etc. |
